		welcome to my journal!

		(entry #1) 01.23.20
		Today was my first day of work so Jaimie, Lena, and I all group facetimed to keep each other company. I worked to style my first title page so I completed my header and designed about 60% of the rest of the page- I'm having difficulty linking my journal.html to the site. 
	</div>

	<div class="entry" id="e2">
		(entry #2) 02.02.21
		I fixed my journal links so I'm working to just fill out this page and format it-- later this week I'll attempt to complete my about me section. 
	</div>

	<div class="entry" id="e3">
		(entry #3) 03.07.21
		Recently I have been exploring with javascript. In classes, Molly has been introducing us to EventListener, variables, and functions. I coded a page so that every time you click, and bee gif loads. Also using javascript, I coded a page that reveals fruit when you click on one of three trees. 
	</div>

	<div class="entry" id="e4">
		(entry #4) 05.18.21
		Our class began work on our final presentations. Over the last two months we were introduced to javascript and functions. I'm not very familiar with certain code for counters and for loops but hopefully coding some more will help.
	</div>

	<div class="entry" id="e5">
		(entry #5) 05.23.21
		After doing a bit more work over the past week, I feel much more comfortable coding in javascript and incorporating different concepts. I just finished up most of my presentation but I have some small changes to my website and codesketches that I'm working on.
